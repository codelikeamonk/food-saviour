# Food Saviour
World hunger is on the rise, despite the work of people and organisations (such as the UN and World Bank) to tackle this problem. The global spend to make worldwide access to food possible reaches into billions of dollars, by looking at this problem. 

We have to come to a solution, a platform wherein we are collecting food which might go into the bin and with our platform we are making it possible to spread the extra food to the poor and needy.

# Who can donate?
Restaurants, Events, Catering industry, households. Anyone with our App.

# How will the donated food be distributed?
We will partner with NGOâ€™s where they will collect food available from the receive section of our app according to their fulfilments.
